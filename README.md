# Enhance Landsat Imagery
## Pipelines to apply classic and ML methods to upscale landsat imagery

This code is part of the class INE410121-41000025DO/ME (20242) - Visão Computacional, lectured by Prof. Aldo von Wangenheim

### Notebooks:
- classical_computer_vision_resolution_enhance contains the classical method Lanczos pipeline;
- convolutional_resolution_enhance contains CNN pipeline, with sentinel 2 images as training data.

### Scripts:
- pre_trained_resolution_enhance applies the pre-trained model Real ESRGAN to landsat imagery;
- plot_split_images creates splitted plots between original image and enhanced image.

File paths are mostly hardcoded. Reproduction of results will require code editing to run.


The code was made by Henrique Faria Cordeiro, Beatriz Nattrodt, Juan Flôr de Amorim and Matheus de Medeiros Pereira.
